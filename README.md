# CNN-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CIFAR-10-dataset.

This repository contains code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.

## Overview

Describe briefly what your CNN model does and what problem it aims to solve. Mention the architecture or approach you've used.

## Files

- `train.py`: Python script to train the CNN model.
- `test.py`: Python script to evaluate the trained model on test data.
- `model.py`: Python script defining the CNN architecture.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data loading and preprocessing.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies for the project.

## Usage

Explain how to use your code, for example:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Train the model: `python train.py`
4. Evaluate the model: `python test.py`

## Results

You can mention the performance metrics of your model here, such as accuracy achieved on the test set.
