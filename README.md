# CNN Model for CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Introduction

This repository contains code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CNN model is designed to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of 10 categories.

## Overview

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

The goal of this project is to build and train a CNN model that can accurately classify these images.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To implement a CNN architecture suitable for image classification.
- To train the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- To evaluate the trained model and report its performance metrics.

## Approach

### Data Preprocessing
The images are loaded and preprocessed using Python and libraries such as NumPy and OpenCV. Data augmentation techniques such as random flips, rotations, and normalization are applied to improve model generalization.

### Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction followed by fully connected layers for classification. Batch normalization and dropout layers are used to improve training performance and reduce overfitting.

### Training
The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate scheduler. Cross-entropy loss is used as the optimization criterion, and the model is trained over multiple epochs to converge to optimal weights.

### Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to measure its accuracy and other performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrix and classification report are generated to analyze model performance across different classes
